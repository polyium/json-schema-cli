Additionally, there includes documentation, examples, and scripts relating to:

- Python packaging best practices
- Private package registries
- Private CA certificates and considerations
- Virtual Environments
- Local development opportunities and implications

## CI-CD

The project includes a [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](./.gitlab-ci.yml) file that demonstrates automated-related builds, testing,
and other useful "workflows" or "pipeline" logic. While not compatible with GitHub, configuration
is relatively the same and straight forward.
